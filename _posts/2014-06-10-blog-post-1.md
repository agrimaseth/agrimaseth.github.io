While working with Computer Graphics at IIST. I was assigned the task of studying various methods for re-creating the real world objects. To begin with I studied the Geomtric Modelling method. This required me to study various mathematical algorithms and concepts like bezier curve, fractals for successful re-creation of shapes and different lighting models like monte-carlos ray tracing method.

The reult for the same is displayed below:

After the successful creation of the above environment. I decided to use 5dt Data Gloves to navigate through the system and to give an immersive 3D animation to it. I used the Vizard platform to perform the animation

Geometric Modelling presented some major disadvantages from being labour intensive to time consuming. Thus, I used the 3D warping technique. In this, several 2-D images were used and after mapping the corresponding pixels in these images Point Cloud Library was used to create their 3-D model in opencv using python. The reult for the same is displayed below:

After, the above implementation I performed a comparitive study of Geometric Modellinga and Image based Rendering.<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5024">Pre-print</a> for which is at arxiv.
