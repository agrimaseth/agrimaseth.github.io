While working with Computer Graphics at IIST. I was assigned the task of studying various methods for re-creating the real world objects. To begin with I studied the Geomtric Modelling method. This required me to study various mathematical algorithms and concepts like bezier curve, fractals for successful re-creation of shapes and different lighting models like monte-carlos ray tracing method.

The reult for the same is displayed below:

After the successful creation of the above environment. I decided to use 5dt Data Gloves to navigate through the system and to give an immersive 3D animation to it. I used the Vizard platform to perform the animation

<!--   <p> After, the above implementation I came across some of the disadvantages of the said method and hence decided to try a different approach, i.e; <a href="proj2.html">Image Based Rendering 3d Warping technique</a></p> -->

Aren't headings cool?
