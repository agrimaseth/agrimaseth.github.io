Indexing and evaluating the indexed ClueWeb12-B dataset and wrote an algorithm for automated query reformulation usingconcepts of graph theory 

During June-July 2015 I got an opprtunity to work as a undergraduate summer research at  [Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/) under the guidance of [Prof. Josiane Mothe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=V-Nyr0wAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) with her team SIG.

During this period, I performed a comparatative study with the aim to find a better method of indexing Clueweb12-B(shards and complete dataset) using terrier. Thereafter, I devised a method for automated query reformulation using the concepts of graph theory such as indegree of nodes linked to the query terms and used them to query the ClueWeb12-B dataset. The algorithm showed positive results with a subset of the actual data and the testing for the complete dataset is scheduled during December 2015
