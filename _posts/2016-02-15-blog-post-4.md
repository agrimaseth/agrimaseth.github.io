A comparative study on the flow of information about a catastrophic topic on Twitter and conventional news channels. Paper Published at [19th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems](https://iceis.scitevents.org/Home.aspx?y=2017#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20the%2019th,business%20applications%20of%20information%20systems.). Awarded first position in Amalgam, alumni sponsored competition at Army Institute of Technology, 2016.

For my undergraduate capstone project, I worked as an undergraduate research student at [Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse](https://www.irit.fr/en/home/) under the guidance of [Prof. Josiane Mothe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=V-Nyr0wAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

The project aims at determining the flow of a particular news article on Twitter and on news channels. Further, based on the flow, we determined how the two mediums of flow affect each other in terms of the subject's popularity.
