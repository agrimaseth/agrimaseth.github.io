Pro-active fault detection in Cloud System using Machine Learning Algorithms like- Sparse Coding and Single label SVM

During November 2014 I got an opprtunity to work as a research apprentice to [Prof M.C. Govil!](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=I4rS3hoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) at [Malaviya National Institute of Technology!](http://www.mnit.ac.in/new/) on fault tolerance in cloud systems.

During, this period I tried re-implementing [Fault Management in Map-Reduce through Early Detection of Anomalous Nodes" by Selvi Kadirvel, Jeffrey Ho, Jos√© A. B. Fortes!](https://www.usenix.org/conference/icac13/technical-sessions/presentation/kadirvel). I monitored the heartbeat of the hadoop cluster using Ganglia. Further, I created a  Model and performed Single label SVM to classify the healthy nodes and recognise the anomalous nodes.
