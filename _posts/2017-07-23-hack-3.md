An embedded system to track the position of the sun throughout the day to increase the efficiency of the sunlight harvesting systems.

The position of the sun continuously keeps changing throughout the day. Hence to make the solar devices more efficient, I created a device that changes direction with change in the light source position using Arduino, servo motors as the rotatory mechanism.
