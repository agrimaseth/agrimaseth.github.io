The project aims at applying recent progress in Machine Learning techniques to the automation of this process allowing the check of large volumes of data in real-time and improving the ability to de-tect unexpected features. The test implememntation was presented to a panel of Physicist and Computer Scientist, I was awarded the 2nd position for my work. 

I was selected as a summer research student under the [Openlab Program](https://openlab.cern/) to collaborate with two researchers Dr. Gianluca Cerminara and Adrian Alan Pol of [Compact Muson Solenoid group at CERN](https://cms.cern/detector)

The project aims at applying recent progress in Machine Learning techniques to the automation of this process allowing the check of large volumes of data in real-time and improving the ability to detect unexpected features. A test implementation using an unsupervised machine learning model focused on the data of one of the CMS muon detectors has been developed and bench-marked on real and fake data.
