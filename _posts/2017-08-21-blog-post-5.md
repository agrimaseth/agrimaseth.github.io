The project aims at applying recent progress in Machine Learning techniques to the automation of quality assessment allowing the check of large volumes of data in real-time and improving the ability to detect unexpected features. The test implementation was presented to a panel of Physicist and Computer scientists; I was awarded the 2nd position for my work. 

I was selected as a summer research student under the [Openlab Program](https://openlab.cern/) to collaborate with Dr. Gianluca Cerminara and Adrian Alan Pol of the [Compact Muon Solenoid group at CERN](https://cms.cern/detector)

The project aims at applying recent progress in Machine Learning techniques to the automation of quality assessment allowing the check of large volumes of data in real-time and improving the ability to detect unexpected features. A test implementation using an unsupervised machine learning model (autoencoder) focused on the data of one of the CMS muon detectors (drift tubes) has been developed and bench-marked on real and fake data.
