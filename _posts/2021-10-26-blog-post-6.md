With the world trying to resume all activities as they were before the COVID-19 pandemic, citizens need to judge their risk levels from gatherings and activities. The numerous determinants and the evolving nature of risk make it confusing for the public to understand the risk from various activities. Hence we created this [risk calculator app](https://realsciencecommunity.shinyapps.io/riskcalculator/), the paper will be uploaded soon.

This work was done in collaboration with [Dr. Christin Glorioso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christin-glorioso-md-phd-39627719/) Epidemiologist, Physician, and Founder and CEO of the non-profit research organization, Academics for the Future of Sciences (AFS))
