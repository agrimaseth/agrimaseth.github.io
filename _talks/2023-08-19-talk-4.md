In this talk, I present the paper published at ACL 2023, in which we introduce a new approach to identifying inappropriate communication by explicitly modeling the social relationships between individuals. We introduce a new dataset of contextually situated judgments of appropriateness and show that large language models can readily incorporate relationship information to identify appropriateness in a given context accurately.
